# improved-garbanzo

Ok, first of all I have to admit Im having way to much fun with the automatic project name generator on GitHub.
This is a imulator and Future Controller of Multi-node 3D Printer. ItÂ´s is a work in progress in a resarch project where the aim is to create a 3D printer that prints concurrently with multiple indevidual extruders. Currently working hard on building a mechanical model that makes sense. Building the "Garbanzo" is more of a secondary goal at this stage, so stay tuned for updates. 

## TODO:
1. Update the README and explain what your goal actuallty is
2. Add targetPlanner
3. Add GRBL parsing.
